## ðŸ’» Project
Mario Kart is a series of racing games developed and published by Nintendo. Our challenge will be to create the logic 
of a video game to simulate Mario Kart racing, taking into account the rules and mechanics below.  

Players:  

The Computer must receive two characters to compete in the race on one object each
Clues:  

Characters will race on a random track for 5 rounds  
In each round, a block of the track will be drawn, which can be a straight, curve or confrontation.  
If the track block is a STRAIGHT, the player must roll a 6-sided die and add the SPEED attribute, whoever wins gets a point  
If the track block is a CURVE, the player must roll a 6-sided die and add the MANEUVERABILITY attribute, whoever wins gets a point  
If the track block is a CONFRONTATION, the player must roll a 6-sided die and add the POWER attribute, whoever loses, loses a point  
No player can have a negative score (values below 0)  
Win condition:  

In the end, whoever has accumulated the most points wins.
